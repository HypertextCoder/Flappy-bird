# Flappy Bird Game

## Description

This project is a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game. The player controls a bird, which moves continuously to the right. The player must tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and avoid obstacles, such as pipes. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns the player one point. The game ends if the bird collides with an obstacle or falls to the ground.
